1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,500
I beleive the American Dream is still alive. In fact, I'll bet a million dollars on it

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,500
You, my friends, was labeled a loser least likely to success. No one thought I would ever make

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Billionaire Glenn Stearns is betting a million dollars he can take a hundred bucks and grow it into a million dollar business in just 90 days

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:37,500
If it's a penny short of a million, I'll put 1 million dollars into it. But to keep experiment fair, I'm gonna do it all undercover. I won't use my name, my money or my connections. Win or lose in the city of Erie and the people who help me get there will be rewarded, but they don't know it

5
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:47,500
With a million dollars of his own money on the line, Glenn Stearns will see once and for all if the dream is still possible in America

6
00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:08,500
In his first week in Erie, Pennsylvania, billionaire Glenn Stearns gave him self a goal of making $3.300 to cover his living expenses for the entire 90 days.. but feel short

7
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:18,500
With just under $415 in his pocket, he's got 82 days left to build a million-dollar business

8
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:44,500
I fell like crap. I've been sleeping in my truck for over a week and a snowstorm came in last night. I made roof over my head

9
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Need to make money. I need to get going 

10
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:08,500
I can't stop throwing up. Just scared. Don't know what's wrong with you

11
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Do you want to keep going?

12
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:23,500
- What do you want to do?
- I have to go to the hospital

13
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:43,500
I made my first million at 28 years old. The reality is I'm not in a 28 years old body anymore. I gave myself a goal of make $3.300 before I get an apartment but if something's seriously wrong with me, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to keep going

14
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:58,500
- What's the lastest greatest?
- It doesn't look like you can see anything on the x-ray which is nice and you know, my blood pressure's back to normal. My fever is gone. So, I hope I dodged a bullet

15
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Check me out, don't have a flu, so put some fluids in me and actually feeling a lot better. Ryu's dude poisoning or in fact, it basically run down

16
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,500
The last thing I need right now is a hospital bill but I'm happy to pay $250 to know that I'm ok and then I can keep going

17
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:26,500
I got to get out of strut. You just can't build a business the way I'm living right now. I've gotta get place

18
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:44,500
I still haven't hit my goal of covering my living expenses for 3 months and I don't have any money to get into an apartment. Not only that, but I'm 9 days in and I still have no idea what business I'm gonna start

19
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,500
I need my million dollars idea but I still need to make some money

20
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:59,500
I've been checking abandoned lots along the rail line searching for industrial tires and wrought iron to resale. I've got almost every lot out there but there's a few left to try

21
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Fencing, tires, looking a little bit more promising back here

22
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Find your buyer first and work backwards. I know some buyer and willing to pay 4 or $500 for industrial tiers so I'm gonna continue searching along the rail line to meet that demand

23
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Let's well look at this tire first. Here's a good one right? Here. Alright. Look at this, man

24
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:51,500
There we go. This is comedian lower. I've got these on my ranch. Finding the freakin needles and the haystacks. Can't get any better that this

25
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
That's the might be good, too

26
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:11,500
- Hello
- Hey, is this Cody
- Yes
- I was reading your ad, about you tires and I think I got 4 or 5 of them that you may be interested in
- Ok, perfect

27
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:23,500
- Hey Cody
- Hey
- How you doing
- I'm not too bad. What do we have here?

28
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:31,500
- That might be a little tiny tractor or something
- It's like a pickup tire
- Is it
- No, that one there's pretty wore down
- How this one's looking?

29
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:42,500
This one's really old. Yeah, it's a lot of dry rot on this one. The tread, see all the dry cracks. That's not any good either.

30
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:55,500
- I think we'll pass on these two. Interesting these ones
- That's some kind of military tire, right?
- Yeah, Deuce and a half. This is for like a large loader or a forklift log loader.
- It's got a lot of life in it still

31
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:11,500
- What are you looking at to get out of them
- I was thinking about well 1800
- With the cuts and stuff upright, can't go that much price. You like 1400?
- 1400

32
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:28,500
- So you level with me, how about 69
- I'll do 15
- 15, oh you got a deal with. Hey thanks
- Cash alright?
- Cash works great matter of fact

33
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:43,500
That's exactly what I needed. Ok, just get beat up, beat up, beat up working here ass off and I've finally hit the big one

34
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:51,500
I didn't make my goal but I've got enough for a place to live. I need to make do with the money I have and keep moving forward. Finally

35
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:15,500
- Hi, it's Bob. Is it?
- Yes, it is
- Bob, hi, my name is Glenn Bryant. Listen, I'm looking for a budget-friendly apartment and wanted to know if you had anything available
- What's your price range?
- Well, about $400 a month

36
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:29,500
- Perfect, I am available anytime. I could come over even right now.
- Sure
- Thank you very much

37
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:35,500
I am going to find an apartment at least hunting for on today

38
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:45,500
When I was first researching living expenses, I budgeted $625 a month for an apartment but since I didn't hit my first financial goal, I need to come in much lower than that

39
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:56,500
I'm hoping I can get into an apartment for $400, you know, I'm not expecting to be in a great place see what I could afford

40
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:09,500
I'm gonna show you these 2 apartments up here. This is gonna be one of the apartments number 9 here. Got a decent-sized bathroom, nice storage here is wild tub and shower and this is gonna be 405

41
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:16,500
- Where's the bedroom?
- This would be your bed room. This is considered efficiency. This would be your living room and bedroom combine 

42
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:38,500
- I think you'll like this one here. This is gonna go into your kitchen and what's nice about this. You get French doors great here. Nice little fake fireplace
- What's this one run 
- This is gonna be about 435 and it's gonna include just your water sewer trash. I would need a first month's security deposit. You have any question?

43
00:08:38,500 --> 00:09:01,500
- Can I give you my first month's rent and then give you half the deposit and I can two weeks and half the deposit?
- I can't do that. I would need a security deposit up front to hold the unit because if I had another client that came in and put down the security deposit right on the spot. Money talks
- Ok. Alright, I'll take it

44
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:18,500
So, I ended up with the more expensive apartment. $435 vs $405 but reality, I'm off the road. I don't have anybody in the side of me so there's a lot of things that make this one just a much more efficient apartment and there's something I can live in for the next 90 days

45
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:26,500
- There's that for you.
- It's hard to belive that I feel so happy to have a place

46
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Perfect. You know when I'm sitting in my car and having to worry abount where I am. It doesn't allow you to think about business or growing anything and just in survival mode. So having you own place, it's such a huge deal

47
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:52,500
No toilet paper, no bath towels, no so. Even though it's not the Taj Hahal, it's a place just to call my own 

48
00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:10,500
I've been so used to living a cush life and now, everyday figuring out how to make 5 or 10 dollars or how to get a job, doing anything finding, you know, some other's person trash on the side of the road, that's worth something

49
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Anyway, it's a very humbling experience. I'm grateful I have a roof over my head right now but I really need a place where I can start a thrive and get my confidence back

50
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Glenn Stearns will see once and for all

51
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:47,500
With my living arrangements set, I now have to figure out what business I'm gonna start. I'm running out of time but I have a plan and I'm hoping this will save me before it's too late

52
00:10:50,500 --> 00:11:01,500
The truth is starting a successful business is to choose something that the market need and build a great team. Identify a need and fill it. But I also need to do this in less than 3 months

53
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:07,500
If I'm gonna build a million dollar business, I need to use local resources here, in Erie

54
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,500
- Hi, Glenn
- How are you?
- So nice to meet you 

55
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:21,500
- I've heard a lot of grate things
- Yeah, well, we're exicted to have you. So, you've decided to be an entrepreneur and that's what exactly what we're here to do is help in these new ventures so

56
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Thousands of communities accross the country have a small business development center. These center often have resources for business owner include consulting, office space, computer access and research

57
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,500
The best part of the SBDC is that these services are offered for free

58
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:49,500
- This is a shared space, we use this classroom, we use this meaning, we use this conference room
- So if I were building my team, I could utilize this space
- Yes
- Ok, great

59
00:11:49,500 --> 00:12:08,500
This is the Beehive. The Beehive is all around business development building business plans, feasibility of business ideas market, research things like that. We can't run your company for you but we make sure you're prepared to do it

60
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:19,500
I am absolutely exicted. I mean the SPDC is a wonderful resource. I mean it's like everything you could ever want to start a business right there
- Appreciate it off ladies bye-bye

61
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
Now I need to figure out what kind of business I'm going to start

62
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:37,500
I've done my research and got a couple ideas that I'm kicking around in my head. However, I haven't been in Erie. I don't know, you know, what's going on in the area. I don't know what I don't know 

63
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:48,500
So I've set up meetings with a few entrepreneurs to see if they can help me figure out which is the right industry for me. I've warned them that the cameras are gonna be following me

64
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:59,500
The first is Hannah Kirby who runs a coffe shop and it's doing quite well. You know, there's a 7% growth in coffe sales which makes it really the fastest growing segment in the food industry

65
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,500
- You know, I've just arrived in Erie
- Wellcome
- Thank you

66
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:23,500
It's kind of looking maybe just start a business and you pop up just about everywhere. So, white coffee, what was that, just a passion

67
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Yeah, something I really enjoyed. You know you look at our downtown district, there's only one coffee shop in town and so, it's like why is there not a local space

68
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,500
- So, I just felt like the environment and the ecosystem was the right timing
- The hell is you your business doing


69
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:49,500
- The business is paying for itself. We've been here like a year now, so, it's going well

70
00:13:50,500 --> 00:14:00,500
I do think that Glenn is coming into the city and a great time we are very focused on growth. You know, people are really rooting for one another because we are I think we're all rooting for the city

71
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Well, my next stop is Chris truck, he own a metal fabrication company. Erie has deep roots and manufacturing and if you gonna start a business here, it has to be something to consider

72
00:13:18,500 --> 00:14:33,500
I'm a custom fabricator. We do anything that goes on the truck. So, steel, aluminum, stainless, we can build anything mild to wild. This truck, for example, we'll get the box taken off the chassis. I'll come out from under it and everything underneath will be replaced so brand-new

73
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:41,500
- Tell me how does this work
- Yeah, we take steel and we use a plasma cutter. You ready?
- Let's go

74
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,500
- Well, how cool is that
- It's warm

75
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:59,500
- That's awesome
- 50 ton break slide it in and hit those tabs. There you go

76
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:11,500
- They used to make these things to last forever you know?
- Yep, and we picked up the dyes in different places. You can still use the dyes in a brand new machine. More steel, four foot shear, 50 ton break

77
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:20,500
We can cut Bend, just about anything, you know, that we need to do and as we buy more equipment, we can expand our offerings

78
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,500
It's just like a scissor on the back so to come down a little bit on an angle and slighty

79
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:36,500
It's got. First 4 years have been extremely difficult but I think we're on the outside of it and hopefully next year, we'll, you know, double the business

80
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:51,500
- So what's been what do you think's been the hardest?
- I'd say funds are tough. Anyone who talks somebody that owns a business thinks that they're rich but we're really rich for about 10 seconds as one check passes, it goes to pay another bill

81
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:59,500
- As I continue to build out a team, I'd love to talk to you about more stuff. I appreciate this so much. I really great to meet you

82
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Truth be told, I'm not gonna start a metal fabrication company. The amount of startup capital I would need to buy that heavy-duty equipment, it's just cost prohibitive. But man, Chris is talented. So, no matter what business I start, I know I'm gonna need someone like him in my court

83
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:32,500
I'll tell you a business that's really taking off here in Erie is the craft beer business. It's been growing about 10 to 15% a year. So I'm meeting with Chris Siri Ani who owns the brewery at Union Station

84
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Love to see that's an industry that's worth getting into

85
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:43,500
We do about 500 barrels a year, 3 days a week we're back here

86
00:16:45,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Making beer and besides our beer, you know, 12 or 24 beer on tap. We have another forty bottles from PA Brewers. Back here we have 6 seven barrels fermenters and whatever we make in 2 or 4 weeks is on top, it's usually gone in another couple of weeks. So very quick turnover which is a lot of planning down the road. Make sure that the pipelines are filled and the pints are fills at the bar

87
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:16,500
In theory, I think entrepreneurs, in general especially young entrepreneurs are on the same page and working together and collaborating but the Brewers especially

88
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:37,500
- What's the advantage of being so collaborative two things
- When all the same issues and problems and a lot of us have the same goal, you know, we're all brewing the same thing water yeast hops and barley right? You know, we're done as much as incubator a local brewery to help them open up as far as somebody that wants to open a business. Erie's the right place in the right time now for craft beer 

89
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Craft beer looks very promising. These local Brewers seem to support one another and with their help, I can get my product to market very quickly. But I also see the potential in coffee. It can feel the need of a local community and has the potential to compete nationally. I'm gonna get in touch with the Small Business Development Center and have them start researching coffe and beer

90
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,500
So I can determine what the best business to start

91
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Where I land on coffee and beer, I'm gonna need some serious startup funds to get this business off the ground. The best way that I know to make big money is in real estate, so I want to buy a house to flip it to cover the startup cost for my business

92
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:32,500
But for now, I need to think on a smaller scale. So my goal for this week is $10.000 for the down payment for the flip house. And the best way to do this is by purchasing assets and then using them to make more money

93
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:40,500
My idea this time is I want to go to car dealers and I want to see if I can't buy some of their trade-ins 

94
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:52,500
Dealerships take hundreds cars as trade-ins every week. Some get reconditioned to be sold on the lot. But cars that are older and have high mileage get sold to auto auctions for a fraction of what they're worth.

95
00:18:52,500 --> 00:19:00,500
If you can buy these cars from dealers before they send them to auction and turn around and sell them yourself. There's the potential to make a hefty profit

96
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Climb em low, sell em high and hit my goal of $10.000

97
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:17,500
I'm gonna stop into this dealer. You guys just stay where you are. Car dealers get freaked out when a bunch of cameras show up

98
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:31,500
- How you doing? My question for you, do you sell any or trade ins?
- No, I'm sorry, we're in receivership right now. We just filed for bankruptcy. I can't actually, legally, sell anything on this lot

99
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:41,500
He said we're not selling anything. So it must have gone under, too bad.

100
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,500
I see some dealerships up here

101
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:59,500
- Hey Greg, hey Dad, I'm Glenn. I'm just curious you have any cars that you might be sending off to auction that I could purchase here
- Let me check. I'll be right back
- Yeah, ok

102
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:07,500
- We just don't feel comfortable selling, you know, like a 3, 4, 5 or $6.000 car
- No big deal

103
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Well, that was a bus. I can't believe they're not interested in selling me a car that they're gonna take the auction. Hopefully, it's not the case of the other dealers

104
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:37,500
This is gonna be my trashcan. It's pretty good. Oh, darn fork

105
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:58,500
This is my 3rd night. I really don't have anything. I've gotta spend some of that money on probably a bed and something to sleep, at least something to sleep on and some covers and pan and a few other things, but..

106
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:07,500
he's wagering he can start a million

107
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:22,500
It was harder than it was in college but I signed up for it so I should be thankful I am thing, you know, it's raining not my truck

108
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:32,500
So I mean I have to have something to lay on, need a bed. Maybe I maybe just a sleeping bag's fine but something soft

109
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Should I need to get a pan, I need to get a lamp. Wouldn't mind a lamp. I need to get, you know, just your basic needs, right?

110
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Probably a couple glasses. That's about it, I think

111
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:07,500
-------------------------------------

112
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:09,500
I can't wait another day to choose the business that I'm gonna start so I'm headed over to the Small Business Development Center to check out the reaseach I asked them for well

113
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,500
- Exicted to delve in and see what you guys have found
- You have a variety of options here

114
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Time is ticking away in its decision time.
- This is it

115
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Exicted to delve in and see what you guys have found.

116
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Most people don't have experience deciphering complex charts and figures. So having the resource like the SBDC can help potential business owner learn what they need to be successful

117
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:51,500
You mention the particular industry that you interested in were breweries and coffee. We pulled from a number of resources that we have avaiable, so you have an idea of the competitive landscape as well

118
00:22:51,500 --> 00:23:07,500
- What would you say are the pros and cons of these in this?
- Well, coffee, we want everyday. So when we are looking the desire or need or want in the community, our customers coffee shop, that's a very big problem

119
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:23,500
- Con is the environment can become convoluted because there are so many
- Why don't we do breweries? The ibisworld report is predicting that it's going to be higher growth over the next 5 years. And you see, you know what? What are people drinking? Craft beer when most of those growth comes from

120
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:36,500
You know when I found in this industry what, at least was exciting for me, was they're not as opposed to new people coming into their industry. They actually welcome it and they try to help you can start it

121
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Yeah, it's a new industry. So, it makes sense for the players to work together, to grow it. A big con and I guess we need to call it that are the barriers to entry because you do need licenses and it take a while to get that done

122
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:07,500
- Equipment cost go along that right?
- And the pro is you're in the community that like their beer and they also like their craft beers

123
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:15,500
On average household spend about $100 more beer away from home than they do on coffee so beer, may be it's more profitable but

124
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:26,500
After hearing all the research, I'm definitely gonna open a craft beer business. People are spending money on it, the industry is in continual growth and it is potential to scale nationally.

125
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Plus, it's a collaborative field, so my plan is to connect with other local breweries to utilize their instructure which will help me with my savings on equipment cost. I know I can make craft beer a million dollar business

126
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:50,500
I want to start finding team members so I would appreciate it if I could utilize a computer because I want to put a ad out there for recruiting some more people

127
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Absolutely would love to help you with that

128
00:24:52,500 --> 00:25:05,500
Once you have a direction ahead in, one of the most important things you can do is surround yourself with people who can strengthen your weaknesses. I'm gonna post a ad online saying them looking to build a team my brewing business

129
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:18,500
I want to target people who are passionate about bringing a new local business here in Erie. I want to hold an open interview, I want to look for an experienced Brewer and then someone who can really help with website design

130
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:24,500
If I don't have the right team, I've gotta figure this out

131
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,500
Now that I figure out that I want to start a craft brewery, I've got to see what it takes.

132
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:40,500
Chris Suriani from Union Station brewery put me in touch with a local brewer name Brian Sprague is gonna show me the ropes. Hopefully I'm not in over my head

133
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:47,500
What's vital when you go into business is making sure that you know all aspects of the business. That means know your

134
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:57,500
That's why I'm gonna learn more about brewing process today. I want to know what I'm talking about when I speak to people about the craft beer business

135
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:09,500
- We're gonna make a beer today. We're gonna mash in. You're gonna help this guys mash it
- Perfect, ok.

136
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,500
Well, there are many different styles of beer. There are 4 key steps to brewing 

137
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:22,500
First is mashing. Malted grains are steeped in hot water, which activates enzymes that cause it to break down and release its sugar.

138
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:30,500
The liquid drain from that mash is called wort which is basically unmade beer. Similar to how dough is unmade bread 

139
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,500
- So this is basically sugar water at this point
- Yep

140
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Second is boiling. The wort gets boiled while hops and other spices are added for flavor

141
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,500
So, that's more the flavor, that's kind of..

142
00:26:44,500 --> 00:27:00,500
- Next is fermentation, the wort goes into a fermenting vessel yeast gets added. It's stored for a couple of weeks while the yeast eats up all the sugar, turning them into alcohol and carbon dioxide. And finnaly, the beer gets kegger bomb and that enjoy

143
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:14,500
- It's so much more you get out of it once you see what's put into making a batch of beer
- A little more involved and a lot of people think
- I'd love to know some of the pitfalls, some of the struggles you had

144
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:22,500
- The taxes, insurance, you know, that's something I guess you can't avoid. No matter what you have to pay tax to the state and federal government on every barrel you make

145
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:29,500
Of course you're hopeful to sell it and make that money back. There're a lot of regulatory bodies that are involved. Building code and all that stuff

146
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:35,500
You work with an attorney. Do you have anyone that's in the business that you work with?

147
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:44,500
You know, as far as, you know, Ted's elders - the kind of main guy and they will help you with licensing. They will do all that

148
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,500
Having a lawyer that can help you with the permits - that I need to open my business quickly - is so important

149
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:58,500
I'm used to having a team of lawyers, they handle this type of task. But now, I can't afford them. I'm gonna go find a car to flip so I can make some money step

150
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:15,500
I need this car flip, you know, most people don't realize that these big dealers, when they get trade-ins with high miles, they want it just to get rid of them. So this is my oppotunity

151
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:29,500
I want to take them of their hands and be able to turn around and sell them for healthy profit. Sells online and I saw a guy that is going out of business with this car lot. Hopefully he's gonna sell me 1 or 2 of his car

152
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:47,500
- So, what happened you just guys just finished? You're done?
- Yeah, this is my dad shop and actually, he's like get rid of everything
- Good. Well, may be I can take this off your hand

153
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:56,500
- Got the old 5 Honda and the Escalade in the back
- Ok, perfect. What's uh, how many miles are on this thing?
- Only 152.000 miles, just under

154
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:03,500
- What do you asking for this?
- This one is 1.200. My dad just want to get rid of it, you know
- We take it for a spin?
- Yeah

155
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:16,500
- How dose this feel? how do you like the handle?
- Isn't really good. What I'm looking for is something reliable that someone else can buy and feel they got a good deal. At the same time I could make some decent money on it, you know

156
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,500
- I mean we want to try and get the best deal still but yeah everything has to go

157
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Honda Civis has a high resale value. The fact that, this is a hybird makes it even higher. So if I could pick this car up for $500, I'm gonna make so much more on my resale

158
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:46,500
- I'm interested, you know, kind of, I think 500 bucks is probably for the car actually
- There's no way I can let you go for 500
- Yeah, how about $600. That seems pretty fair
- Thousand
- C'm on man

159
00:29:52,500 --> 00:30:13,500
- How about $700
- Yeah
- One more thing, I want to also be able to buy you other car because I'm gonna work my tail up and I mean I'll help you out of basically, I'm working for you and I look at it that way
- I like that

160
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:27,500
$700 for the Civic is the good deal. The blue book value on this car is between 2 or $4.000. If I'm going to hit my $10.000 gold for this week, I need to get a close to $4.000 as I can

161
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:41,500
This is the start of the big money. I am going to pretty this thing up, get it ready to sell. Alright, come on now. I think you can put a new set of tires on there

162
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:55,500
Everything's starting to get shiny and new. Starting to get exciting. You always find change in the cars

163
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:02,500
Alright, I gotta forget a lot of eyeballs on this car. This look like a good spot

164
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,500
It's coming. I can feel it. I can see it happening now

165
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Big day today. Small Business Development Center. I'm holding open interview to build out a team

166
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:41,500
One of my most important business principles is human capital. I've been successful because I've surrounded myselft with people smarter than I am. But my most important criteria for hiring someone is their personality

167
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:51,500
You know, in opening a brewery, I'm gonna need people with managerial skill. You know, prople obviously with brewing experience and there may even be a food component into this

168
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:57,500
The problem is I don't have any money to pay these guys. It's all about sweat equity. That's how they're gonna have a piece of this company

169
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:10,500
- What's your background?
- Broadcast communications actually initially
- Tell me about yourself
- My specialty is custom furniture, woodworking

170
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:27,500
- I've been doing that for 16 years now
- My job is sourced overseas circumstantially a local Brewer here in Lavery's brewing. Had lost their Brewer and started learning more brewing on a much bigger scale
- I've been cooking for a long while now. I have like OCD and like, sometime I get like real nervous like, this dress, do I love it, I mean, no like I'm probably gonna die early the heart attack or something but do I handle it, well, no, I don't, you know what I mean

171
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:44,500
- Have you ever been in the web design or any of that?
- A little bit. I feel confident with my content creation ability

172
00:32:44,500 --> 00:33:00,500
When I do an interview, I care about if somebody is gonna fight hard, they're gonna stay long and they're beleive in the company. I'm looking at their eyes. I'm seeing if they stare back at me. I'm seeing how long make blink. It's really not so much about making a whole pie money

173
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:14,500
Probably for the first 2 months, it's gonna be planning, it's gonna be behind the scenes and that's gonna be without pay. I'm looking for people that I hope to see kind of the dream and you know, look back on this and go Wow. Isn't that fun. What we did, you know, what we created

174
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:27,500
- I have a mortgage, 2 sons, I got a wife. Money is kind of like the necessity
- Something like this would be a great experience for me as well and watching someone, you know, kind of build a business from the ground up and be kind of cool


175
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:43,500
Armando, he feel like a good fit. And Chris, I think he's ready to jump in with both feet. It was a great start today. I meet some wonderful people and I'm excited to see if we can't get to the next level with them, see if they'll make a team or not

176
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Come on my way to go meet a guy named Chet - who is very interested in the car

177
00:33:53,500 --> 00:34:08,500
I listed it for $4.500 so hopefully we can get somewhere close to there. I'm down to my last hundred dollars. So listen, I'm pulling up , just do me a favor and hang back. I don't want him to think anything funny's going on 

178
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:23,500
- Saw you post about this
- Well, it's 2005. It's got 152 miles on it and everything is running well

179
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:40,500
- You're asking for $4.500. Is there anything, anything you can do?
- It retail for about $4.800. So, you know, I though $4.500, it was pretty fair
- But you know
- Make me an offer and I'll see what I can do 

180
00:34:40,500 --> 00:35:01,500
- Can you do $3.300
- I think good probably not. 300 off, about $4.200
- How about #3.400
- You know, how about if we do $3.900. We'll just call it's a day

181
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,500
- Can I do a test drive
- Well, of course

182
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:18,500
- I am desperate I need the car flip, right? I'm an animal in the corner, injured, ready to come out and fight. My heart is pounding

183
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:28,500
- There's a smooth drive. Yeah, $3.900, I'll definitely do it

184
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:46,500
I won at $4.500 but you always have to leave enough that the other person feels that they got a deal as well. I've sold merchandise on the street. I'm sold tires, I've cleaned people's toilet. All to get me to the point where I can have a breathing room 

185
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:57,500
I'm on my way back now to get myself my second car. So my goal for this week is $10.000. I'm gonna take the profit I made from this Honda Civic, flip it into the Escalade

186
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:03,500
- So tell me about this thing here
- It's gonna run you 2.500 
- Ok, a couple things

187
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:16,500
It's an all-wheel drive car, right? So if one of these tires are bad, I've got to go replace them all. That's three a thousand bucks. I'm buying it as is so you know, I think we should look at something close to $1.200

188
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:22,500
- $1.200 is a little low. Can we do $1.500
- Got a deal

189
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:32,500
The Blue Book value of it is anywhere from $6.900 to $8.800. I'm hoping to get at least $7.500 out of it

190
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:40,500
I'm gonna go put it on my lucky street corner. Cross my fingure. If I can get this sold, I'm gonna make my 10.000 for the week

191
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:03,500
- Hi there
- Hi
- How are you?
- I'm great
- How's your day?

192
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:08,500
- My day was wonderful. Again, I'm keep having a good days. I went to the Salvation Army and I got myself some stuff for the apartment. So that was a good day

193
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:25,500
- What did you get?
- Oh what I get the one. I'll just show this. Ok, this is my bed, let me see it.
- .....
- Yeah, got myself some kitchen supplies

194
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:37,500
- Did you get the toilet paper?
- Didn't get any of this stuff for the bathroom
- Alright, I love you
- Love you too

195
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:55,500
So, I'm headed out to meet the people that have made the first cut to be team members. We're gonna do a bar crawl today. I'll learn who kind of stand out, maybe as a leader

196
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Since I don't know the area well, this is my chance to get feedback from locals on the idea and how to make this brewery stand out here in Erie and I've got to keep reminding myself it's not only that I'm evaluating them but they are probably evaluating me just as hard

197
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:23,500
Instill confidence. If your team doesn't believe in you, you're going nowhere. So part of running a successful business is to make sure your team believe in the vision as much as you do

198
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:40,500
I also invited RJ. When I was working with RJ last week, I told him that I wanted to start a business here in Erie and he agreed to come down, meet every body and learn about it. He's someone I really want on the team

199
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:50,500
And I asked Matt Sanders to join us. Matt reached out after the open interviews and he has a background in liquor distribution so he could be a great asset to the team

200
00:38:53,500 --> 00:39:05,500
The older you get, you get more conservative because you're gonna "I don't want to start over again". Well I thought I'm gonna start over again. I mean, why not? I don't know what's gonna happen but I don't want the 9-to-5 job right now

201
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:14,500
You have a dream and a vision and you go for it. I want to do a brew house but also brand it and get it bigger so it can go statewide and then see if it can go bigger than that

202
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,500
And I tell you I really couldn't think of a better place than Erie

203
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Even in a short amount of time that I've been here, I love Erie

204
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
Alright, let's move to the next one

205
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:30,500
So I think the most important thing that we can do is make this brewery about the local underdogs, the hard-working people of Erie

206
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:39,500
One concern I have is ok, so this guy not from here, he wants to come the area, start a brewery, who knows nothing about brewery, kind of wondering if someone is gonna be like well, wait a second

207
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:54,500
- Could take from your murca sure
- But we're like you know ... We want to make it work so I think that's already got a huge advantage
- Yeah, that's true, you know you could have brought in a bunch of outside consultants like that wouldn't have worked

208
00:39:39,500 --> 00:40:03,500
Most of the time when somebody say, you know: I should start this business bla bla and it never go any farther. And here is Glenn in 55 and he's like: No we're gonna do this

209
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:10,500
- You got to have respect for that and I would love to be a part of that because that's awesome
- Thank you all, appriciate everything

210
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:20,500
It's great hearing from the team and I love their enthusiasm and they sound invested and I think they see the vision. And that's important. This is going to belong to them

211
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:32,500
What's the most popular one you have? Can we get 7 of the tattooed ladies and one of the oatmeal

212
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:51,500
- So, what do you think's missing in these brew houses like what it is that
- I think you pair with good food like these guys have something good going because they have good beer in here and then you can walk outside and bring good barbecue inside
- It's a new thing for Erie or

213
00:40:51,500 --> 00:41:04,500
Well I think in the food world, barbecue is like craft beer. Everyone can get their own niche in their own recipe. So, barbecue pops up like craft beer does because everybody has their own little spin on it

214
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:16,500
I'm interested in food component but I think I had my hands full with this brewery first. 
I wouldn't have taken barbecue for Erie and yet it feels like barbecue is like really the hot thing in Erie now 

215
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:33,500
Yeah, last like 5 years. I mean we started about 5 years ago and then Federal Hill smokehouse about a year after us. There was a couple barbecue joints before that but yaeh, it's really yeah didn't get popular 

216
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Time is not on my side. I will need to find a recipe, brew my beer, work on permitting, find a location and open it. I need to start moving on it now

217
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:57,500
So I reach out for the lawyer today that Brian Sprague recommended - Ted Zeller. He is gonna give me some advice on how to open a brewery. But before he talked to me, he needs a thousand dollar retainer

218
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,500
A thousand dollar out of my pocket right now. It's very hard but you know, I need the advice 

219
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:17,500
- I understand you might be trying to get into the brewery ...
- I am. Could you start me out from kind of zero and explain to me what I'm gonna need to do

220
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:26,500
- So, before you can apply for a state or federal permit, you need to have your site
- Cuz they don't have the lease
- If you do not attach your lease with your federal app, they will allow you to file it

221
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:50,500
- And then how long does that take to get?
- Stabilized to take 60 to 75 days if you're lucky. The federal, you know, back in December. So processing time's went from 40 days to over hundred days and you can not operate your brewery permit from the state without your federal license as well

222
00:42:50,500 --> 00:43:04,500
- That's the problem
- When there's just no way you can brew your all beer under your own brewery permit for at least 90 days. There's no way

223
00:43:11,500 --> 00:42:14,500
I am so screwed

1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,500
I beleive the American Dream is still alive. In fact, I'll bet a million dollars on it

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,500
You, my friends, was labeled a loser least likely to success. No one thought I would ever make

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Billionaire Glenn Stearns is betting a million dollars he can take a hundred bucks and grow it into a million dollar business in just 90 days

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:37,500
If it's a penny short of a million, I'll put 1 million dollars into it. But to keep experiment fair, I'm gonna do it all undercover. I won't use my name, my money or my connections. Win or lose in the city of Erie and the people who help me get there will be rewarded, but they don't know it

5
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:47,500
With a million dollars of his own money on the line, Glenn Stearns will see once and for all if the dream is still possible in America

6
00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:08,500
In his first week in Erie, Pennsylvania, billionaire Glenn Stearns gave him self a goal of making $3.300 to cover his living expenses for the entire 90 days.. but feel short

7
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:18,500
With just under $415 in his pocket, he's got 82 days left to build a million-dollar business

8
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:44,500
I fell like crap. I've been sleeping in my truck for over a week and a snowstorm came in last night. I made roof over my head

9
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Need to make money. I need to get going 

10
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:08,500
I can't stop throwing up. Just scared. Don't know what's wrong with you

11
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Do you want to keep going?

12
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:23,500
- What do you want to do?
- I have to go to the hospital

13
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:43,500
I made my first million at 28 years old. The reality is I'm not in a 28 years old body anymore. I gave myself a goal of make $3.300 before I get an apartment but if something's seriously wrong with me, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to keep going

14
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:58,500
- What's the lastest greatest?
- It doesn't look like you can see anything on the x-ray which is nice and you know, my blood pressure's back to normal. My fever is gone. So, I hope I dodged a bullet

15
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Check me out, don't have a flu, so put some fluids in me and actually feeling a lot better. Ryu's dude poisoning or in fact, it basically run down

16
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,500
The last thing I need right now is a hospital bill but I'm happy to pay $250 to know that I'm ok and then I can keep going

17
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:26,500
I got to get out of strut. You just can't build a business the way I'm living right now. I've gotta get place

18
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:44,500
I still haven't hit my goal of covering my living expenses for 3 months and I don't have any money to get into an apartment. Not only that, but I'm 9 days in and I still have no idea what business I'm gonna start

19
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,500
I need my million dollars idea but I still need to make some money

20
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:59,500
I've been checking abandoned lots along the rail line searching for industrial tires and wrought iron to resale. I've got almost every lot out there but there's a few left to try

21
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Fencing, tires, looking a little bit more promising back here

22
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Find your buyer first and work backwards. I know some buyer and willing to pay 4 or $500 for industrial tiers so I'm gonna continue searching along the rail line to meet that demand

23
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Let's well look at this tire first. Here's a good one right? Here. Alright. Look at this, man

24
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:51,500
There we go. This is comedian lower. I've got these on my ranch. Finding the freakin needles and the haystacks. Can't get any better that this

25
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
That's the might be good, too

26
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:11,500
- Hello
- Hey, is this Cody
- Yes
- I was reading your ad, about you tires and I think I got 4 or 5 of them that you may be interested in
- Ok, perfect

27
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:23,500
- Hey Cody
- Hey
- How you doing
- I'm not too bad. What do we have here?

28
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:31,500
- That might be a little tiny tractor or something
- It's like a pickup tire
- Is it
- No, that one there's pretty wore down
- How this one's looking?

29
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:42,500
This one's really old. Yeah, it's a lot of dry rot on this one. The tread, see all the dry cracks. That's not any good either.

30
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:55,500
- I think we'll pass on these two. Interesting these ones
- That's some kind of military tire, right?
- Yeah, Deuce and a half. This is for like a large loader or a forklift log loader.
- It's got a lot of life in it still

31
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:11,500
- What are you looking at to get out of them
- I was thinking about well 1800
- With the cuts and stuff upright, can't go that much price. You like 1400?
- 1400

32
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:28,500
- So you level with me, how about 69
- I'll do 15
- 15, oh you got a deal with. Hey thanks
- Cash alright?
- Cash works great matter of fact

33
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:43,500
That's exactly what I needed. Ok, just get beat up, beat up, beat up working here ass off and I've finally hit the big one

34
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:51,500
I didn't make my goal but I've got enough for a place to live. I need to make do with the money I have and keep moving forward. Finally

35
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:15,500
- Hi, it's Bob. Is it?
- Yes, it is
- Bob, hi, my name is Glenn Bryant. Listen, I'm looking for a budget-friendly apartment and wanted to know if you had anything available
- What's your price range?
- Well, about $400 a month

36
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:29,500
- Perfect, I am available anytime. I could come over even right now.
- Sure
- Thank you very much

37
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:35,500
I am going to find an apartment at least hunting for on today

38
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:45,500
When I was first researching living expenses, I budgeted $625 a month for an apartment but since I didn't hit my first financial goal, I need to come in much lower than that

39
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:56,500
I'm hoping I can get into an apartment for $400, you know, I'm not expecting to be in a great place see what I could afford

40
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:09,500
I'm gonna show you these 2 apartments up here. This is gonna be one of the apartments number 9 here. Got a decent-sized bathroom, nice storage here is wild tub and shower and this is gonna be 405

41
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:16,500
- Where's the bedroom?
- This would be your bed room. This is considered efficiency. This would be your living room and bedroom combine 

42
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:38,500
- I think you'll like this one here. This is gonna go into your kitchen and what's nice about this. You get French doors great here. Nice little fake fireplace
- What's this one run 
- This is gonna be about 435 and it's gonna include just your water sewer trash. I would need a first month's security deposit. You have any question?

43
00:08:38,500 --> 00:09:01,500
- Can I give you my first month's rent and then give you half the deposit and I can two weeks and half the deposit?
- I can't do that. I would need a security deposit up front to hold the unit because if I had another client that came in and put down the security deposit right on the spot. Money talks
- Ok. Alright, I'll take it

44
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:18,500
So, I ended up with the more expensive apartment. $435 vs $405 but reality, I'm off the road. I don't have anybody in the side of me so there's a lot of things that make this one just a much more efficient apartment and there's something I can live in for the next 90 days

45
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:26,500
- There's that for you.
- It's hard to belive that I feel so happy to have a place

46
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Perfect. You know when I'm sitting in my car and having to worry abount where I am. It doesn't allow you to think about business or growing anything and just in survival mode. So having you own place, it's such a huge deal

47
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:52,500
No toilet paper, no bath towels, no so. Even though it's not the Taj Hahal, it's a place just to call my own 

48
00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:10,500
I've been so used to living a cush life and now, everyday figuring out how to make 5 or 10 dollars or how to get a job, doing anything finding, you know, some other's person trash on the side of the road, that's worth something

49
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Anyway, it's a very humbling experience. I'm grateful I have a roof over my head right now but I really need a place where I can start a thrive and get my confidence back

50
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Glenn Stearns will see once and for all

51
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:47,500
With my living arrangements set, I now have to figure out what business I'm gonna start. I'm running out of time but I have a plan and I'm hoping this will save me before it's too late

52
00:10:50,500 --> 00:11:01,500
The truth is starting a successful business is to choose something that the market need and build a great team. Identify a need and fill it. But I also need to do this in less than 3 months

53
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:07,500
If I'm gonna build a million dollar business, I need to use local resources here, in Erie

54
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,500
- Hi, Glenn
- How are you?
- So nice to meet you 

55
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:21,500
- I've heard a lot of grate things
- Yeah, well, we're exicted to have you. So, you've decided to be an entrepreneur and that's what exactly what we're here to do is help in these new ventures so

56
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Thousands of communities accross the country have a small business development center. These center often have resources for business owner include consulting, office space, computer access and research

57
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,500
The best part of the SBDC is that these services are offered for free

58
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:49,500
- This is a shared space, we use this classroom, we use this meaning, we use this conference room
- So if I were building my team, I could utilize this space
- Yes
- Ok, great

59
00:11:49,500 --> 00:12:08,500
This is the Beehive. The Beehive is all around business development building business plans, feasibility of business ideas market, research things like that. We can't run your company for you but we make sure you're prepared to do it

60
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:19,500
I am absolutely exicted. I mean the SPDC is a wonderful resource. I mean it's like everything you could ever want to start a business right there
- Appreciate it off ladies bye-bye

61
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
Now I need to figure out what kind of business I'm going to start

62
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:37,500
I've done my research and got a couple ideas that I'm kicking around in my head. However, I haven't been in Erie. I don't know, you know, what's going on in the area. I don't know what I don't know 

63
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:48,500
So I've set up meetings with a few entrepreneurs to see if they can help me figure out which is the right industry for me. I've warned them that the cameras are gonna be following me

64
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:59,500
The first is Hannah Kirby who runs a coffe shop and it's doing quite well. You know, there's a 7% growth in coffe sales which makes it really the fastest growing segment in the food industry

65
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,500
- You know, I've just arrived in Erie
- Wellcome
- Thank you

66
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:23,500
It's kind of looking maybe just start a business and you pop up just about everywhere. So, white coffee, what was that, just a passion

67
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Yeah, something I really enjoyed. You know you look at our downtown district, there's only one coffee shop in town and so, it's like why is there not a local space

68
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,500
- So, I just felt like the environment and the ecosystem was the right timing
- The hell is you your business doing


69
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:49,500
- The business is paying for itself. We've been here like a year now, so, it's going well

70
00:13:50,500 --> 00:14:00,500
I do think that Glenn is coming into the city and a great time we are very focused on growth. You know, people are really rooting for one another because we are I think we're all rooting for the city

71
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Well, my next stop is Chris truck, he own a metal fabrication company. Erie has deep roots and manufacturing and if you gonna start a business here, it has to be something to consider

72
00:13:18,500 --> 00:14:33,500
I'm a custom fabricator. We do anything that goes on the truck. So, steel, aluminum, stainless, we can build anything mild to wild. This truck, for example, we'll get the box taken off the chassis. I'll come out from under it and everything underneath will be replaced so brand-new

73
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:41,500
- Tell me how does this work
- Yeah, we take steel and we use a plasma cutter. You ready?
- Let's go

74
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,500
- Well, how cool is that
- It's warm

75
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:59,500
- That's awesome
- 50 ton break slide it in and hit those tabs. There you go

76
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:11,500
- They used to make these things to last forever you know?
- Yep, and we picked up the dyes in different places. You can still use the dyes in a brand new machine. More steel, four foot shear, 50 ton break

77
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:20,500
We can cut Bend, just about anything, you know, that we need to do and as we buy more equipment, we can expand our offerings

78
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,500
It's just like a scissor on the back so to come down a little bit on an angle and slighty

79
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:36,500
It's got. First 4 years have been extremely difficult but I think we're on the outside of it and hopefully next year, we'll, you know, double the business

80
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:59,500
-----------------------------------------------------------

81
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:59,500
doing this for 10 years as long as I've

82
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:59,500
known him he loves to be challenged

83
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:59,500
that's about it I know you can do it I'm

84
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,230
excited for you cuz even wanting to do

85
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,380
this work for a long time

86
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,360
we've talked about it for a long time in

87
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,340
the 16 years we have been together I

88
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,170
can't tell you how many people have said

89
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,430
I don't know how you're gonna do it and

90
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,020
then he does let it go I guess okay

91
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:05,680
after you say goodbye say goodbye of all

92
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,470
the shirts love you baby okay

93
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,170
hey I'm gonna miss you guys

94
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,019
thank you thank you my daddy

95
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,310
the American Dream is so alive there are

96
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,010
a lot of people that think you have to

97
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,440
be of means to ever be able to climb

98
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,910
that ladder because you have to have a

99
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,760
good head start I hope what this does is

100
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,620
it shows people that no you don't have

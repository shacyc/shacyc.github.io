00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,500
For the first time in decades, the next generation of Americans may be poorer than their parents.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Seems like it work harder or make less money.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,500 
72% of Americans think the American Dream is beyond our reach.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Is the American Dream dead?

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
This dream is going to decline in decades.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,500
This billionaire is betting it's alive.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,500
You, my friend, was labeled a loser at least likely to success.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
No one though I would ever made.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
I went from rags to riches but it's wasn't luck.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,500
30 years ago, Glenn Stearns started with nothing and build a billion dollar landing company - one of the largest in the country.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:40,500
But have the times changed the principles that got me rich and how I'm gonna get rich again.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,500
But talk is cheap. Right? I'm gonna prove it.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Glenn is betting a million dollar of his own money that he can take a hundred bucks and grow it into a million dollar business in just 90 days.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,500
But I understand that I get treated differently because I'm wealthy.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:1:02,500
Well, for most people the desk is stacked against them. So, to keep the experiment fair, I'm gonna do it all undercover.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,500
I won't use my name, my money or my connections.

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:16,500
I'll go to the city where I don't know a soul and I'll start from the bottom with only a hundred bucks, a cellphone with no contacts and an old pickup truck.

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,500
I'm gonna work with locals to build this company. Because I know I can't do it alone.

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
You in or out?

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Sounds like a beautiful idea. I'm in.

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
I know it won't gonna be easy.

22
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
his own money he can take a hundred

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,500
but I've never been afraid of hard-work.

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Pump man on my way.

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,500
At the end of the 90 day, Gleen's business will be independently evaluated

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,500
If it have a penny short of a million, I'll put 1 million dollars into it.

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Win or lose, the people help me get there will be rewarded. But they don't know it.

28
00:01:51,500 --> 00:02:01,500
With a million dollars of his own money on the line, Gleen Stearns will see once and for all if the dream still possible in American.

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:16,500
My name is Gleen Stearns and with hard-work, I'm worth money.

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,500
If you told me when I was growing up that this would be my life, I would have never believed you.

31
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,500
I was born two alcoholic parents diagnosed dyslexic and failed the fourth grade.

32
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,500
I fathered a child at 14 and graduated at the bottom 10% of my class.

33
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,500
The cards was stacked against me ever succeeding

34
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,500
but I move West with a drseam of doing better than my parents and making something to myself.

35
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,500
I saw an opportunity in the loan business and I struck out on my own with my first company when I was 25.

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:25,500
company because I know I can't do it

37
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I busted my ass to grow that company into one of the largest lenders in the country.

38
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Now I have a jet, a yacht and houses around the world.

39
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,500
- For reacher for poorer. 
- For reacher for poorer.
- That's hard to say, is that?

40
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:16,500
What I'm most proud of is my beautiful family and I have 6 amazing kids ranging in age from 10 to 40.

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,500
- Nondescript blend in an important
- And never blended
- I know, this is gonna be a challenge for you

42
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Linda's been talking honestly about doing this for 10 years, as long as I known him. He love to be challenged.

43
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:49,500
- That's about it.
- I know you can do it, I'm excited for you cuz even wanting to do this work for a long time. We've talked about it for a long time.

44
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,500
In the 16 years we have been together, I can't tell you how many people have said "I don't know how you're gonna do it", and then he does.

45
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
- Let it go
- I guess okay

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,500
- After you, say goodbye
- Say goodbye 

47
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:14,500
- Of all the shirts
- Love you baby
- I'm gonna miss you, guys.

48
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,500
- Thank you thank you
- Bye daddy
- Bye

49
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:14,500
on the line

50
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
The American Dream is so alive 

51
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:50,500
There are alot of people that think you have to be of means to ever be able to climb that ladder because you have to have good head start.

52
00:04:50,500 --> 00:05:01,500
I hope what this does is it shows people that "No, you don't have to have a big bundle of cash or you know, Daddy Warbucks behind you", that you can do it youself.

53
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Gleen has begun the journey but he has no idea where he's going

54
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,500
He's wagering he can start a million dollars business anywhere in American

55
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
- Take him wherever they want to go
- Yes sir

56
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:26,500
It's still hasn't really sunk it to be honest because I'm still in the middle of a lot of fancy things

57
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,500
- That are right cleared takeoff
- All right. Here we go

58
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:14,500
two alcoholic parents diagnosed dyslexic

59
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Getting a little nervous now

60
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,500
If you're going to start a company, it could take anywhere from a six months to year or more.

61
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:59,500
But since I have only 90 days, I need to identify a need in the market and scale the company up incredibly fast

62
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,500
I don't know where I'm going but there's an opportunity everywhere

63
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Where there's a cold out there
Let us know

64
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:47,500
It looks like we are landing in Pennsylvania

65
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Gonna be an adventure

66
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Welcome to original airport servicing Pennsylvania. The temperature is 25 degrees C.

67
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,500
I'm hearing Pennsylvania. I haven't never been to Erie Pennsylvania

68
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Thank you sis. Here we go.

69
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:59,500
The clock is now started and Gleen has 90 days to build a million dollar business in Erie Pennsylvania
--------------------------------
70
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:14,500
You can't build a business when survival is your full-time job. You've got to cover the basics first before you can build anything bigger.

71
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,500
So I need to look around Erie and figure out what its costs to service here

72
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,500
I'm gonna have to be very smart about we I spent my money.

73
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:36,500
If I spent it all on shelter, then I'm screwed. So, I've got to be very efficient and look at clever way of being able to put a roof over my head

74
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:06,500
my beautiful family and I have six

75
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:52,500
A city of 97.000 people located in northwestern part of Pennsylvania. Here he is in between Cleveland, Buffalo and Pittsburgh

76
00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:02,500
The first time what strikes me is to seem the power of what used to be. Right? The remnants of an industry that has so much life    

77
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:16,500
It won the American City award in 1972. But with the outsourcing of American manufacturing, it's seen a steady decline in population as job providers and families scattered to make do elsewhere

78
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:37,500
I didn't want to pull over and figure out what is it gonna take for me to live here.

79
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:53,500
What it looks like is I'm gonna need about 1.100 dollars to cover my rent, gas and food per month. And I've got 3 months. So really my total is 3.300 dollars. So that's gonna be my goal for my first week. 

80
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:05,500
I have to grow this $100 into $3.300. Now I realize that this is more than most people make in a month but I'm gonna do it in 7 days without knowing anyone.

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,500
I'm hungry and I gotta go pee. 

82
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Stuffs is so expensive.

83
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,500
A gold mine. 3 for $2. You can't beat that. 

84
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,500
$11.26 not bad. You don't have a bathroom, do you?

85
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,500
- Do you give water, hot water?
- Sure.
- I would appreciate it

86
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:55,500
- Then I'm gonna ask the weirdest question of the mom. You don't have little fork, plastic folk
- I do
- You do, success

87
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
This might be my bed for the night

88
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:30,500
I have 100 bucks and I can find a hotel but I'm gonna use up half my money probably at least. I got a nice bed right here so speak. Listen, I don't have any time to waste here so I'll place an ad right now for anything that I can do with my truck.

89
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:39,500
I mean from scrap metal removal to clean-out services. You know, shoot I mean clean houses, anything. It's doesn't matter to me.

90
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,500
It's just like fishing. The more lines you have in the water, the better chance you have in the getting a hit

91
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,500
89 more days

92
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,500
I've reach the bottom quickly and I'm gonna claw my way back up

93
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Sleeping in the car sucked so I've gotta figure it out today because I can't do it forever

94
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:37,500
I'm gonna focus this week on comming up with $3.300 so that I can cover my living expenses for next three months.

95
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Every minute that I'm focused on survival is really a minute I'm not focus on the business 

96
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Recognize you strengths and weaknesses. There are a lot of high paying hourly jobs here in Erie and I'm not even remotely qualified for

97
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Manufacturing jobs requrie some real skill that I don't have. 

98
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:09,500
But I'm a salesman. I've been my whole life. It would be great to be get any job at this point but if I'm gonna get out of survival mode fast, my best bet is to find something to sell

99
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Look at all the abandoned buildings. I mean they're just great material left on the side of the road or even in scrap yards and some of them are still worth money.

100
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:24,500
So if I could find these discarded items, I can potentially flip them for hopefully a lot of money.

101
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:35,500
We've got to find my buyer. It's one of the principles of my whole life is find your buyer first and the rest is fall on place

102
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:42,500
So, there's people out there looking for wrought iron fencing military-grade tiers

103
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Some buyers, they'll pay four to five hunderd dollars a pop for them

104
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Find your buyer first and work backwards based on what they want. Most people do it wrong. They create a prodcut and then they go looking for someone to sell it to

105
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Lining up the sale first is difference between hot commodities and junk

106
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,500
One man's trash is another man's treasure. You get all this.

107
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,500
See me. Fence I'm looking for

108
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Authentic wrought iron fencing has not been commercially produced in the US since the 60s. Modern wrought iron is actually forged steel or aluminum. So the heavy-duty real deal can be worth up 3$ per pound.

109
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,500
That's a good industrial tires out here

110
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Loggers, miners and farmers use industrial and military vehicles to get their jobs done. But new wheels can be expensive, so you tires with good tread sell for several hunderd dollars apiece

111
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Yes, most of these are out automobile tires that doen't work for me. And then these, see this is what I'm looking for with a cut in half. I don't work. So close, it's a lot harder than I thought.

112
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,500
People like to dump at these abandoned buildings because they don't have to pay anything.

113
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:12,500
There's an old freight line that runs through the center of town here that has a bunch of closed industrial buildings on either side.

114
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:20,500
These old manufacturing plants used to load directly onto the freight train

115
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:26,500
So I'm gonna start at the one end of the city and I'm gonna work my way accross following these tracks

116
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,500
I'm not looking for car tires I can't sell those

117
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:40,500
So many times that people throw away things of value. They just have to find a buyer to connect to

118
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,500
This is not what I'm looking for. These are worthless

119
00:14:50,500 --> 00:15:00,500
I'm getting seriously low on cash and I don't figure something out. And I just got to stay at it. Plenty of more places to try

120
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:17,500
I am beat from sifting through all this junk all day. Feel pretty filthy. Expect admit I'm not used to sleeping in my truck. So, you know, a nice shower with a real bed, it really did me some good

121
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:26,500
I've been looking online for the cheapest motel where I'm hoping that the owner let me do some work. I don't want to have to pay for the room

122
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:34,500
- What I do for ya
- Yeah, do you have a room tonight?
- Yes, it's 51
- 51 dollars, ok

123
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:55,500
- Were you taking care of this now?
- Yes, I will. Is there.. Do any work to do? Like could I work and help viewers or anything like that/
- Right now, I don't have. I'm more like a one-man crew. You know, I have another gentleman that help me and I got my son here. 

124
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:02,500
- Right, 51 right?
- And 45 plus taxes
- Right, every dollar count

125
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Well, I have to pay full price for the room. But at least, it's a cheapest room in the town. I don't really have any time to go out and try to negotiate with anyone else

126
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:26,500
You got $100 in your pocket. While I thought that was very little having $38 in your pocket is a lot less

127
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Okey. I still haven't gotten any responses for my post offering myselft up for cleaning hauling out garbage. I feel like I could make a lot of money relatively easy but trying to make a hundered bucks or a thousand dollars is nearly impossible

128
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Tow days in and I haven't made any money to cover my living expenses. However, it's not the time to give up.

129
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:08,500
People miss out on a lot of opportunities when they panic and quit too early. I'm gonna continue applying for every job I can find and look for things for sell

130
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Very very hot shower. Finally first I've been one a few days

131
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:36,500
I spent two-thirds my money just on food and shelter here. But I found a listing for a commission based gig. I need to head there now and check it out and see what it's all about

132
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:46,500
They're going to see an eerie rubber fatory. They have a sale job, so maybe I can take that. I'm exicted

133
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,500
John's the owner of the company. So I'm gonna go in meet him and see what he needs

134
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:59,500
- Hello, how are you going? I'm John
- Hi John. How are you? Very nice to meet you
- Nice to meet you, too
- Come on back.

135
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:42,500
around Erie and figure out what it costs

136
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:42,500
to survive here I'm gonna have to be

137
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:42,500
very smart about where I spend my money

138
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:42,500
if I spent it all on shelter then I'm

139
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:11,500
This is actually our largest project. We're developing a dog toy so we want to expand into a pet brand and our brand is one leg up.

140
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:19,500
- So, onething that we have available for you is helping us sell the dog toys. You can make commission on that. It's a kind of part-time thing
- Pays that

141
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,500
That might work. You know, that sounds good

142
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:32,500
Emissions only a dollar a ball but I can play to my strengths of sale

143
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
All these dogs

144
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
How are you guys

145
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,500
This ball, they've just made. It's made here in Erie. You guys, do you guys buy?

146
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Oh yeah, I think you do. The dog toys. Oh look at these guys. I got a customer. All right, let's go go. Will I get it back?

147
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,500
- What do you think?
- No, that's okey. Thank you.

148
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:09,500
- So this ball, this is an Erie rubber company's made this. Right? Everything. How do you fell it?
- Yeah. I would say .. Good luck

149
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,500
It's cringing. This is out of my element. Okey. I really am, you know, i  mean

150
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:26,500
You know, I haven't done something like this since I was probably 12 years old selling newspapers. So we've got a local gentleman in town is making this balls

151
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:32,500
- I wish you guys the best of luck
- I didn't sell one ball. All these dogs are not one ball

152
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,500
I went against my own principle of find your buyer first

153
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:46,500
This ticking clock is putting the pressure on but going forward, I need to stick to the idea that made me successfull or I'll never get off the ground

154
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,500
I'm gonna visit Chris Campbell at the Lincoln foundry. I'm trying to cast as wide of a net as possible for this job search

155
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:59,500
I'm a little concerned that I may not have the necessary skill need it to work and manufacturing. Probably a long shot and we'll see

156
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:18,500
- So we have different areas for different jobs
- So what are you making?
- All kind of different parts, automotive industry, gas and oil industry, air pumps, air valves. We make molds and we pour metal in tech

157
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:26,500
So there's where it start to mold making process and they get weights on them to make sure that the bottom and the top of pressing real tight

158
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,500
You don't want any metal to squirt out the side

159
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:37,500
- The other side reporting for a variety of different alloys stainless fields. The hot stuff!
- Holly cow

160
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,500
That's a little bit pulled around 1500 or 1600 degrees

161
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:57,500
- What are you good at?
- Well, I'm good at sales. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty. I don't have, you know, real skill with heavy machinery or anything but

162
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:10,500
- I mean it's not just a place where you sell shoes
- So what kind of work do you need when you
- Here?
- Yeah
- At this time, we really don't have any spots

163
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:22,500
And when I walk through the foundry, my goodness. I mean, it's a dangerous place to work. Obviously, I'm not one that has worked that well with my hands in the past 25 years

164
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,500
So, I knew I was out of my element, knew it somewhere that could probably get me hurt

165
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:43,500
Now you have $8 on number one. Thank you. Do you have a restroom?

166
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:51,500
I can't even afford to fill up my truck. I got about 3 gallons out of it to get me around the block

167
00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:05,500
I'm still looking for those salvageable items like industrial tires wrought iron fencing. I see a bunch of tires. It could be promising

168
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Yeah, what I'm looking for. They're just 2 worn 

169
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:52,500
And I came at this so confident that I could take $100 to turn it into million dollar business and you know, I just didn't expect to lose everything and I've got to get creative here because I don't have any more money

170
00:22:52,500 --> 00:23:02,500
So, might volunteer at a soup kitchen that way, you know, I could work for a meal so to just take one. I don't feel right take

171
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:09,500
So, I reach out to one of them online and they said they'd be happy to help me. Just come on in and ask for Laura

172
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:15,500
- Is Laura here?
- I'm Laura. Come on in
- Hi, how are you?
- How are you, good
- Nice to meet you

173
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,500
- Are you Glenn?
- I am
- Okey, Nice to meet you. Thanks for coming

174
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:33,500
I'm gonna have you come in here and just ... Throw your coat up on there ... And when he's done there you can wash your hands and I'll get the pair of gloves and get you started

175
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:47,500
- Thank you for helping me
- Sure, where are you from?
- I'm from Baltimore
- Nice
- It's too far, it's too bad
- Like a cold weather
- Well, you know, that's been shockingly cold 

176
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:58,500
- Yeah, it's really cold. Yeah, you can wash them in there. Are some rags up there
- It's not that cold the wind. The wind is what's crazy

177
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:07,500
- We'll start with a little bit of setup like our placemat salt and pepper, sugar, cream on
- You tell me what to do and I figure it out
- Sure, thank you

178
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:21,500
So, let me introduce you. Ron, this is Glenn. Ron is one of the founders of soup kitchen. They serve every Monday and we've been here for 18 years and he founded the soup kitchen with the sisters of St.Joe

179
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:27,500
- This is regular work crew so their addition of desserts
- As my crew

180
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,500
A lot of the cook they're all volunteer. They have a lot of succumbing works. It's awesome

181
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,500
So, this is our regular crew. That's Glenn

182
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:43,500
You could actually go along with her and start the placemats and then we'll come back and do salt and pepper on every table

183
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,500
So people made these, that's great

184
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
It say Patty's Day, I guess that's coming up soon

185
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:15,500
I've given my camera crew a cover story since they need to follow me. They're doing a document on Gleen Bryant who quit his corporate job to start a business later in life

186
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:15,500
time to waste here so I'll place an ad

187
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Going out and living the American Dream trying make it on my own as a business owner and starting it at 55 versus most people started when they're your age


188
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,500
I felt good for helping and then I felt bad because I'm kind of living under this false pretense.

189
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,500
You hungry? All right, let's give you a plate

190
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:13,500
I get it more and more why there's this big divide between those rich SOPs. This people are just thankful for have one meal 

191
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:22,500
- How we doing?
- We are doing terrific. You're doing good job. We might hire you
- Good, I'm hired
- There you go

192
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:13,500
Patient good but the benefits are growing and then after they eat, we eat

193
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:45,500
I go in for hot meal. I come out, really realizing that I've got my life so good and I don't know, just don't know why we got it so good

194
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,500
You know, it make me feel hopeful in the world

195
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:54,500
- That's why you came, don't be guilty
- No.. I.. but I appreciate everything. Thank you
- Thank you

196
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:03,500
It's a reminder that starting a business here isn't just about proving something. It could positively impact a lot of people if I do it right

197
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Let us sleep in my truck again and .. yeah, look like this is a safe spot

198
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,500
It's just rock hard

199
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:44,500
I'm working my way along these rail lines trying to find tires and wrought iron that have been dumped

200
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:52,500
I'm starting run out of rail and gas. It's uncomfortable to have less than $30 to my name but I know I can find this stuff

201
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:58,500
So these abandoned buildings are perfect places for people throw away what they consider junk

202
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,500
I'll take whatever I can get right now. You know

203
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,500
- Hello
- Hey, is this Glenn?
- This is

204
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,500
- Hey this's RJ from ..
- Hi RJ, how are you?
- I'm good, how are you
- I'm excelent

205
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:42,500
- I've got job vacation on job posting ....
- yeah, no. Absolutely I appreciate that. But there's one thing that probably might sound a litte weird

206
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:56,500
You know, I'm come up here from Baltimore. I'm really out to start a new business. But I'm also here with a documentary crew that has decided they want to follow me around and so if that's ok with you there

207
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:17,500
- You mean ...
- Yeah, I mean, it's not too big but you know, there's a couple guys with cameras and sound and those kind of things
- Yeah ...
- I'll come by immediatly 

208
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,500
And my first job, is it? First of many, I hope

209
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:49,500
Ive got the opportunity to make some quick bucks. That's the one thing is you can't have people thinking you're sleeping in a truck. If you do, then you're beyond desperate you. You got to look confident 

210
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:11,500
- Hey
- Hi RJ
- Glenn
- How are you
- Nice to meet you
- Nice meeting you, too
- Thanks for coming in
- Oh, thank you

211
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:19,500
- Appreciate it. Allow me to bring a couple friend alone
- Yeah, no worries as long as .. you know .. they don't get in the way

212
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:25,500
I was ready to turn around and ride, you know, beacause it comes off as Youjust a scary guy that's gonna kick you ass

213
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:37,500
- We have a big St.Patrick's Day order coming up, you know, I'm a little short-staffed right now, so, you know, you'll be helping out of those. So, give you a quick tour, show you around first, and then maybe have you wash some screens today.

214
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,500
- So have you ever seen screen printing done
- I have not

215
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:49,500
You got your press this spins around this way you put your shirts or whatever you're printing on then that thing over there was a conveyor dryer, put the shirt through and that's what cures the incan of the shirt

216
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:54,500
I'll get you changed, show how to do that and I'm gonna kind of let you go for a little bit

217
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:05,500
So no pressure, these are polyester material, these are obviously little more expensive and it's for customer, so you mess it up, it come out of your pay today 

218
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:14,500
- It worked
- Pretty good
- Getting the hang of it
- Looks good
- You got that

219
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:23,500
- Check it out
- Yeah, there we go, that's it
- That works
- That works, you've just made me about 8 dollars and 73 cents
- There we go, 8 dollars and 73 cents, I like it

220
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:30,500
- First step you said was get wet
- Spray down a little bit
- Say hello to my little friends

221
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,500
- What's good to me, you're good
- I do

222
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:56,500
- So, how long you had the store
- So, we've been in this location for a little over 2 years now, you know, long story short.  

223
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:11,500
I worked full-time for the city for 7 some years and a couple years part-time before that and start a hobby clothing line right out of the house camp with the name and the logo, made a couple shirts with 300 bucks and just keep flip in it and flipping it and one more

224
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:18,500
You look at him and you get this dichotomy: Don't judge a book by it's cover and he's a great example of that

225
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Took a big leaf of faith and I retired from the city to pull my pension, gave up everything that and all that security and took this on full-time. I've been doing ever since

226
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:40,500
I love it. It fit my life exactly as well, and we grew up, you know, in a little apartment. I ended up failing fourth grade, I make it to eighth grade, you know, and all of a sudden, I get a girl pergnant  

227
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Everything I'm telling people is real. Right, I mean, it makes it so that I don't have to think about this very hard. The only thing is not exactly accurate is my last name and how much I'm worth

228
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,500
In 6 hours, it's $60

229
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
Thank you very much RJ, I'm really appreciate

230
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:09,500
Making $60 has never felt so good but more than that, I feel that I made my first real contact in Erie which is so important

231
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,500
All you need both one break, finally

232
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:25,500
My strategy is continue making local contacts and getting to know Erie while also finding salvaged goods that I can sell for a profit

233
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:32,500
Before I go back to salvaging, I think I'm gonna check my posts to see if anybody's responded

234
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:40,500
Look like someone's off for me $80 to clean their house, let's do this

235
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:54,500
I've got another opportunity to make some money here in Erie. I'm going to clean somebody's house. They're all for me 80 bucks. I'm not sneezing at $80, that's for sure

236
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:05,500
No job is beneath you. Working hard at a job, any job, build confidence and give your self-worth. That confidence will help catapult you to the next level

237
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:25,500
I know it's stupid but if there's one little spot, I'm looking cute it and chill, it's gone

238
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:32,500
I haven't pick up a mop and probably 20 years. Be honest with you but it's like riding a bike.

239
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:40,500
Mom always say start in the corner. That way you don't have to go back over it. Wanna make mama proud 

240
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:48,500
Growing up, my mom cleaned home. All I could think about was my mom did this every day for years and years and years

241
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Oh man, this is gonna sting. Where is a bag or something 

242
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:10,500
Somebody's got to clean the kitty box. She sacrificed a lot and you know, cleaning house wasn't above her, you know, I mean there was nothing. There wasn't a job above my mom or my dad for that matter, you know, they did wherever it took

243
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:18,500
You know it's humbling but I got paid and you do what you need to do

244
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:34,500
I can not beleive I'm sleeping in my truck again

245
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:50,500
You know I've been noticing a lot of signs around town for the St.Patrick's day celebrations. This may be a great opportunity for me to diversify my efforts 

246
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:56,500
St.Patrick's day is a chance to diversify my efforts. I know there'll be a lot of drunk people that want some green sweat

247
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:06,500
If I buy a merchandise on St.Patty's day at a discounted price, that'll be a huge margin on a resale but I need someone who knows this city

248
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,500
- Hello
- RJ
- Hey, what's up Glenn
- Hey, how you doing

249
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:26,500
I see the big St.Patty's day parade is comming up. There're so many people out there need green in their life on that day. So I was thinking, you know why not go out and take a run at selling it

250
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:34,500
You get your t-shirts, I'll get some St.Patty's swag. We'll make a team go out and see what we can do

251
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:55,500
- Yeah, I like that idea
- I would appreciate having somebody that's real local and know everybody
- ...................
- Cool, alright, looking forward to it, thanks

252
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:10,500
I mean I can go out for my own and try to do this but I don't know the people, I don't have the ability to connect with people or Erie since I'm brand new but RJ, we're gonna end up making it chilly. Tomorrow is  my day

253
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:30,500
So, I just went and picked up a bunch of Irish swag. The best thing to do is buy the St.Patty's day stuff on St.Patty's day

254
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:38,500
It was slashed so cheap. I got the big mylar balloons for 60 cents, I can sell it $5a piece

255
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Investing 101: Buy low and sell high. But the reality is that I've spent all my money. I'm putting it all on the line but look at the arish, I'm completely screwed if this fails 

256
00:37:53,500 --> 00:38:06,500
I had jobs when I was 8 years old. I delivered newspapers for a couple years. I could still remember. Exactly what I would say every time I would knock on the door, had my bundle of papers, someone went open the door and I'll go: Hi.  

257
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,500
I put my foot in the doore so they couldn't shut the door and I say: 

258
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:22,500
Hi my name is Glenn Stearns, I work for the Montgomery County Journal, you can help me win prizes and cash bonuses, we're getting more readers for a paper covers all your local new like sports, editorials, classified ads, wining and dining, other and snorkels and you can win a brand new 10-speed bike 

259
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,500
I would do that 10.000 times a night

260
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:40,500
Happy St.Patty's day
It taught me to read people. What are they doing when they're looking at me and their eyes, are they upset, are they trying to close the door, are they interested. A relationship is what sales all about

261
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,500
If we see any competitors, let me handle it. I'm stealing anything they have

262
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:56,500
I bombed at the dork park. I mean it was embarrassing. I need to step it up at this parade. I've build my whole career on this selling little green trinkets to be easy 

263
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,500
We're selling some swag, anyone want anything? Cheap stuff, necklaces

264
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:12,500
When Glenn told me that: do you want to go down there and sell St.Patrick's a swag I though he was a kind of crazy but at the same time, that's exactly what the people told me when I want to first start  

265
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,500
It's gonna be a leanring experience either way. You're the winner, he'll learn you don't lose.

266
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,500
You look like maybe you might be one of these ain't late on

267
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:56,500
There's no difference between negotiating a 500 million dollar credit line or negotiating a $5 trinkets. The key is knowing how to read people and convincing them that they need what you're selling

268
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:14,500
- What're you thinking?
- We gotta get to the drunk people
- So there's more going on down there
- Maybe we can go to a bar
- We'll sell everything at a bar

269
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:30,500
It's happened to that herd mentality. Get in front of a group and sell them. If you can get just 2 people in that group to buy what you're selling, odds are the whole herd is gonna follow

270
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:57,500
So, RJ and I walk into the Bourbon Barrel and it just immediately, it just hit. People are down there, they're in the festive mood. What do we got, we have a lot of bling, a lot of light 

271
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:10,500
You know, it was just awesome, you know, and we sold out so quickly

272
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:34,500
I mean this guy, RJ, is so dedicated, he's so focused. They literally sold the shirt off his back. I mean, oh my god, he sold his shirt off his back. Can you believe that?  

273
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:43,500
- Sorry with 40 bucks
- That's that bag 
- I say it's a pretty successful night

274
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:54,500
St.Patty's day, I earned some money but the goal for the week is $3.300 and I've got about $400 in my pocket. This is much harder than I ever thought it was gonna be

275
00:41:54,500 --> 00:42:05,500
This is gonna change my entire plan for the next 83 days. I mean I'm here to start a business and I can't even afford a bed to sleep in

276
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:18,500
I think I was just cokcy comming into this. I mean just cocky, you know I forgot how much struggle it is to get ahead. However, I have a goal. I'm not backing down

00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,500
For the first time in decades, the next generation of Americans may be poorer than their parents.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Seems like it work harder or make less money.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,500 
72% of Americans think the American Dream is beyond our reach.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Is the American Dream dead?

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
This dream is going to decline in decades.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,500
This billionaire is betting it's alive.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,500
You, my friend, was labeled a loser at least likely to success.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
No one though I would ever made.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
I went from rags to riches but it's wasn't luck.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,500
30 years ago, Glenn Stearns started with nothing and build a billion dollar landing company - one of the largest in the country.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:40,500
But have the times changed the principles that got me rich and how I'm gonna get rich again.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,500
But talk is cheap. Right? I'm gonna prove it.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Glenn is betting a million dollar of his own money that he can take a hundred bucks and grow it into a million dollar business in just 90 days.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,500
But I understand that I get treated differently because I'm wealthy.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:1:02,500
Well, for most people the desk is stacked against them. So, to keep the experiment fair, I'm gonna do it all undercover.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,500
I won't use my name, my money or my connections.

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:16,500
I'll go to the city where I don't know a soul and I'll start from the bottom with only a hundred bucks, a cellphone with no contacts and an old pickup truck.

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,500
I'm gonna work with locals to build this company. Because I know I can't do it alone.

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
You in or out?

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Sounds like a beautiful idea. I'm in.

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
I know it won't gonna be easy.

22
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
his own money he can take a hundred

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,500
but I've never been afraid of hard-work.

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Pump man on my way.

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,500
At the end of the 90 day, Gleen's business will be independently evaluated

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,500
If it have a penny short of a million, I'll put 1 million dollars into it.

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Win or lose, the people help me get there will be rewarded. But they don't know it.

28
00:01:51,500 --> 00:02:01,500
With a million dollars of his own money on the line, Gleen Stearns will see once and for all if the dream still possible in American.

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:16,500
My name is Gleen Stearns and with hard-work, I'm worth money.

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,500
If you told me when I was growing up that this would be my life, I would have never believed you.

31
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,500
I was born two alcoholic parents diagnosed dyslexic and failed the fourth grade.

32
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,500
I fathered a child at 14 and graduated at the bottom 10% of my class.

33
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,500
The cards was stacked against me ever succeeding

34
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,500
but I move West with a drseam of doing better than my parents and making something to myself.

35
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,500
I saw an opportunity in the loan business and I struck out on my own with my first company when I was 25.

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:25,500
company because I know I can't do it

37
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I busted my ass to grow that company into one of the largest lenders in the country.

38
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Now I have a jet, a yacht and houses around the world.

39
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,500
- For reacher for poorer. 
- For reacher for poorer.
- That's hard to say, is that?

40
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:16,500
What I'm most proud of is my beautiful family and I have 6 amazing kids ranging in age from 10 to 40.

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,500
- Nondescript blend in an important
- And never blended
- I know, this is gonna be a challenge for you

42
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Linda's been talking honestly about doing this for 10 years, as long as I known him. He love to be challenged.

43
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:49,500
- That's about it.
- I know you can do it, I'm excited for you cuz even wanting to do this work for a long time. We've talked about it for a long time.

44
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,500
In the 16 years we have been together, I can't tell you how many people have said "I don't know how you're gonna do it", and then he does.

45
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
- Let it go
- I guess okay

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,500
- After you, say goodbye
- Say goodbye 

47
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:14,500
- Of all the shirts
- Love you baby
- I'm gonna miss you, guys.

48
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,500
- Thank you thank you
- Bye daddy
- Bye

49
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:14,500
on the line

50
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
The American Dream is so alive 

51
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:50,500
There are alot of people that think you have to be of means to ever be able to climb that ladder because you have to have good head start.

52
00:04:50,500 --> 00:05:01,500
I hope what this does is it shows people that "No, you don't have to have a big bundle of cash or you know, Daddy Warbucks behind you", that you can do it youself.

53
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Gleen has begun the journey but he has no idea where he's going

54
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,500
He's wagering he can start a million dollars business anywhere in American

55
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
- Take him wherever they want to go
- Yes sir

56
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:26,500
It's still hasn't really sunk it to be honest because I'm still in the middle of a lot of fancy things

57
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,500
- That are right cleared takeoff
- All right. Here we go

58
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:14,500
two alcoholic parents diagnosed dyslexic

59
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Getting a little nervous now

60
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,500
If you're going to start a company, it could take anywhere from a six months to year or more.

61
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:59,500
But since I have only 90 days, I need to identify a need in the market and scale the company up incredibly fast

62
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,500
I don't know where I'm going but there's an opportunity everywhere

63
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Where there's a cold out there
Let us know

64
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:47,500
It looks like we are landing in Pennsylvania

65
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Gonna be an adventure

66
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Welcome to original airport servicing Pennsylvania. The temperature is 25 degrees C.

67
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,500
I'm hearing Pennsylvania. I haven't never been to Erie Pennsylvania

68
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Thank you sis. Here we go.

69
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:59,500
The clock is now started and Gleen has 90 days to build a million dollar business in Erie Pennsylvania
--------------------------------
70
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:06,500
country now I have a jet a yacht and

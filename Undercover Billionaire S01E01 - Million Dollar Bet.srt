00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,500
For the first time in decades, the next generation of Americans may be poorer than their parents.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Seems like it work harder or make less money.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,500 
72% of Americans think the American Dream is beyond our reach.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Is the American Dream dead?

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
This dream is going to decline in decades.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,500
This billionaire is betting it's alive.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,500
You, my friend, was labeled a loser at least likely to success.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
No one though I would ever made.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
I went from rags to riches but it's wasn't luck.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,500
30 years ago, Glenn Stearns started with nothing and build a billion dollar landing company - one of the largest in the country.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:40,500
But have the times changed the principles that got me rich and how I'm gonna get rich again.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,500
But talk is cheap. Right? I'm gonna prove it.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Glenn is betting a million dollar of his own money that he can take a hundred bucks and grow it into a million dollar business in just 90 days.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,500
But I understand that I get treated differently because I'm wealthy.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:1:02,500
Well, for most people the desk is stacked against them. So, to keep the experiment fair, I'm gonna do it all undercover.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,500
I won't use my name, my money or my connections.

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:16,500
I'll go to the city where I don't know a soul and I'll start from the bottom with only a hundred bucks, a cellphone with no contacts and an old pickup truck.

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,500
I'm gonna work with locals to build this company. Because I know I can't do it alone.

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
You in or out?

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Sounds like a beautiful idea. I'm in.

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
I know it won't gonna be easy.

22
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
his own money he can take a hundred

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,500
but I've never been afraid of hard-work.

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Pump man on my way.

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,500
At the end of the 90 day, Gleen's business will be independently evaluated

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,500
If it have a penny short of a million, I'll put 1 million dollars into it.

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Win or lose, the people help me get there will be rewarded. But they don't know it.

28
00:01:51,500 --> 00:02:01,500
With a million dollars of his own money on the line, Gleen Stearns will see once and for all if the dream still possible in American.

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:16,500
My name is Gleen Stearns and with hard-work, I'm worth money.

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,500
If you told me when I was growing up that this would be my life, I would have never believed you.

31
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,500
I was born two alcoholic parents diagnosed dyslexic and failed the fourth grade.

32
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,500
I fathered a child at 14 and graduated at the bottom 10% of my class.

33
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,500
The cards was stacked against me ever succeeding

34
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,500
but I move West with a drseam of doing better than my parents and making something to myself.

35
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,500
I saw an opportunity in the loan business and I struck out on my own with my first company when I was 25.

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:25,500
company because I know I can't do it

37
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I busted my ass to grow that company into one of the largest lenders in the country.

38
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Now I have a jet, a yacht and houses around the world.

39
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,500
- For reacher for poorer. 
- For reacher for poorer.
- That's hard to say, is that?

40
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:16,500
What I'm most proud of is my beautiful family and I have 6 amazing kids ranging in age from 10 to 40.

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,500
- Nondescript blend in an important
- And never blended
- I know, this is gonna be a challenge for you

42
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Linda's been talking honestly about doing this for 10 years, as long as I known him. He love to be challenged.

43
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:49,500
- That's about it.
- I know you can do it, I'm excited for you cuz even wanting to do this work for a long time. We've talked about it for a long time.

44
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,500
In the 16 years we have been together, I can't tell you how many people have said "I don't know how you're gonna do it", and then he does.

45
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
- Let it go
- I guess okay

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,500
- After you, say goodbye
- Say goodbye of all
-------------------------------------------
47
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,500
will be rewarded but they don't know it

48
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,500
with a million dollars of his own money

49
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,500
on the line

50
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Glenn Stearns will see once and for all

51
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,500
if the dream is still possible in

52
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,500
America

53
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,500
my name is Glenn Stearns and with hard

54
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,500
work I'm worth money you just did

55
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,500
captain if you had told me when I was

56
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,500
growing up that this would be my life I

57
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,500
would have never believed you I was born

58
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,500
two alcoholic parents diagnosed dyslexic

59
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,500
and failed the fourth grade I fathered a

60
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,500
child at 14 and graduated at the bottom

00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,500
For the first time in decades, the next generation of Americans may be poorer than their parents.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Seems like it work harder or make less money.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,500 
72% of Americans think the American Dream is beyond our reach.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Is the American Dream dead?

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
This dream is going to decline in decades.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,500
This billionaire is betting it's alive.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,500
You, my friend, was labeled a loser at least likely to success.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
No one though I would ever made.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
I went from rags to riches but it's wasn't luck.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,500
30 years ago, Glenn Stearns started with nothing and build a billion dollar landing company - one of the largest in the country.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:40,500
But have the times changed the principles that got me rich and how I'm gonna get rich again.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,500
But talk is cheap. Right? I'm gonna prove it.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Glenn is betting a million dollar of his own money that he can take a hundred bucks and grow it into a million dollar business in just 90 days.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,500
But I understand that I get treated differently because I'm wealthy.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:1:02,500
Well, for most people the desk is stacked against them. So, to keep the experiment fair, I'm gonna do it all undercover.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,500
I won't use my name, my money or my connections.

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:16,500
I'll go to the city where I don't know a soul and I'll start from the bottom with only a hundred bucks, a cellphone with no contacts and an old pickup truck.

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,500
I'm gonna work with locals to build this company. Because I know I can't do it alone.

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
You in or out?

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Sounds like a beautiful idea. I'm in.

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
I know it won't gonna be easy.

22
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
his own money he can take a hundred

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,500
but I've never been afraid of hard-work.

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Pump man on my way.

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,500
At the end of the 90 day, Gleen's business will be independently evaluated

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,500
If it have a penny short of a million, I'll put 1 million dollars into it.

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Win or lose, the people help me get there will be rewarded. But they don't know it.

28
00:01:51,500 --> 00:02:01,500
With a million dollars of his own money on the line, Gleen Stearns will see once and for all if the dream still possible in American.

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:16,500
My name is Gleen Stearns and with hard-work, I'm worth money.

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,500
If you told me when I was growing up that this would be my life, I would have never believed you.

31
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,500
I was born two alcoholic parents diagnosed dyslexic and failed the fourth grade.

32
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,500
I fathered a child at 14 and graduated at the bottom 10% of my class.

33
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,500
The cards was stacked against me ever succeeding

34
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,500
but I move West with a drseam of doing better than my parents and making something to myself.

35
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,500
I saw an opportunity in the loan business and I struck out on my own with my first company when I was 25.

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:25,500
company because I know I can't do it

37
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I busted my ass to grow that company into one of the largest lenders in the country.

38
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Now I have a jet, a yacht and houses around the world.

39
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,500
- For reacher for poorer. 
- For reacher for poorer.
- That's hard to say, is that?

40
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:16,500
What I'm most proud of is my beautiful family and I have 6 amazing kids ranging in age from 10 to 40.

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,500
- Nondescript blend in an important
- And never blended
- I know, this is gonna be a challenge for you

42
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Linda's been talking honestly about doing this for 10 years, as long as I known him. He love to be challenged.

43
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:49,500
- That's about it.
- I know you can do it, I'm excited for you cuz even wanting to do this work for a long time. We've talked about it for a long time.

44
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,500
In the 16 years we have been together, I can't tell you how many people have said "I don't know how you're gonna do it", and then he does.

45
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
- Let it go
- I guess okay

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,500
- After you, say goodbye
- Say goodbye 

47
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:14,500
- Of all the shirts
- Love you baby
- I'm gonna miss you, guys.

48
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,500
- Thank you thank you
- Bye daddy
- Bye

49
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:14,500
on the line

50
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
The American Dream is so alive 

51
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:50,500
There are alot of people that think you have to be of means to ever be able to climb that ladder because you have to have good head start.

52
00:04:50,500 --> 00:05:01,500
I hope what this does is it shows people that "No, you don't have to have a big bundle of cash or you know, Daddy Warbucks behind you", that you can do it youself.

53
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Gleen has begun the journey but he has no idea where he's going

54
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,500
He's wagering he can start a million dollars business anywhere in American

55
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
- Take him wherever they want to go
- Yes sir

56
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:26,500
It's still hasn't really sunk it to be honest because I'm still in the middle of a lot of fancy things

57
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,500
- That are right cleared takeoff
- All right. Here we go

58
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:14,500
two alcoholic parents diagnosed dyslexic

59
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Getting a little nervous now

60
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,500
If you're going to start a company, it could take anywhere from a six months to year or more.

61
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:59,500
But since I have only 90 days, I need to identify a need in the market and scale the company up incredibly fast

62
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,500
I don't know where I'm going but there's an opportunity everywhere

63
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Where there's a cold out there
Let us know

64
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:47,500
It looks like we are landing in Pennsylvania

65
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Gonna be an adventure

66
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Welcome to original airport servicing Pennsylvania. The temperature is 25 degrees C.

67
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,500
I'm hearing Pennsylvania. I haven't never been to Erie Pennsylvania

68
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Thank you sis. Here we go.

69
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:59,500
The clock is now started and Gleen has 90 days to build a million dollar business in Erie Pennsylvania
--------------------------------
70
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:14,500
You can't build a business when survival is your full-time job. You've got to cover the basics first before you can build anything bigger.

71
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,500
So I need to look around Erie and figure out what its costs to service here

72
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,500
I'm gonna have to be very smart about we I spent my money.

73
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:36,500
If I spent it all on shelter, then I'm screwed. So, I've got to be very efficient and look at clever way of being able to put a roof over my head

74
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:06,500
my beautiful family and I have six

75
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:52,500
A city of 97.000 people located in northwestern part of Pennsylvania. Here he is in between Cleveland, Buffalo and Pittsburgh

76
00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:02,500
The first time what strikes me is to seem the power of what used to be. Right? The remnants of an industry that has so much life    

77
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:16,500
It won the American City award in 1972. But with the outsourcing of American manufacturing, it's seen a steady decline in population as job providers and families scattered to make do elsewhere

78
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:37,500
I didn't want to pull over and figure out what is it gonna take for me to live here.

79
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:53,500
What it looks like is I'm gonna need about 1.100 dollars to cover my rent, gas and food per month. And I've got 3 months. So really my total is 3.300 dollars. So that's gonna be my goal for my first week. 

80
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:05,500
I have to grow this $100 into $3.300. Now I realize that this is more than most people make in a month but I'm gonna do it in 7 days without knowing anyone.

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,500
I'm hungry and I gotta go pee. 

82
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Stuffs is so expensive.

83
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,500
A gold mine. 3 for $2. You can't beat that. 

84
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,500
$11.26 not bad. You don't have a bathroom, do you?

85
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,500
- Do you give water, hot water?
- Sure.
- I would appreciate it

86
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:55,500
- Then I'm gonna ask the weirdest question of the mom. You don't have little fork, plastic folk
- I do
- You do, success

87
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
This might be my bed for the night

88
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:30,500
I have 100 bucks and I can find a hotel but I'm gonna use up half my money probably at least. I got a nice bed right here so speak. Listen, I don't have any time to waste here so I'll place an ad right now for anything that I can do with my truck.

89
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:39,500
I mean from scrap metal removal to clean-out services. You know, shoot I mean clean houses, anything. It's doesn't matter to me.
---------------------------------------
90
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:07,500
then he does let it go I guess okay

91
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:07,500
after you say goodbye say goodbye of all

92
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:07,500
the shirts love you baby okay

93
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:07,500
hey I'm gonna miss you guys

94
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,019
thank you thank you my daddy

95
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,310
the American Dream is so alive there are

96
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,010
a lot of people that think you have to

97
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,440
be of means to ever be able to climb

98
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,910
that ladder because you have to have a

99
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,760
good head start I hope what this does is

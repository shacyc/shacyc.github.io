00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Made roof over my head. 2 weeks into his 90-day challenge. How much is this fun? Glenn Stearns has just over $4.000 in his pocket

2
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Erie is the right place in right time now for craft beer.

3
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:13,500
- And decided on his million dollars idea.
- I am really about the possibility of craft beer
- Here is to the future

4
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:21,500
But now, he's back to square 1

5
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,500
- Cheers up
- Alright, thank you so much
- Sure
- Bye bye

6
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:49,500
I'm so screwed. I've got 90-day deadline and I'm finding out I will not be able to get a license in time. So, I've got to figure out something else that archives that goal

7
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:59,500
The bad news: My idea to start a brewery has gone up in smoke. I need a brewery license to manufacture my own beer but I can't get one in the 90 day time line that I set for myself 

8
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Life is like that. Ok. So, you know you got to just continue to get up and do it again and figure it out. Man, if it's not one thing, it's another

9
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Be ready to pivot. Not every deal goes as planned and a good business persion is always prepared to handle the quick turns and failures. That comes with running or starting a business

10
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Base on my research, they're spending about $100 more on beer than they do on coffee. And talking with loca breweries, I still feel that beer is a sound business stagety. So, I need to be creative and find a business where I can sell beer without Brewers license, but I have an idea

11
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:59,500
When I was out with my team other day. 
- So, what do you think's missing in these brew house?
- I think you pair it with good food

12
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:10,500
I noticed most breweries don't have food. This could be an oppotunity for a pivot
- There's a police call Federal Hill which is really good at barbecue as well
So now, I'm checking out Federal Hill smokehouse

13
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:32,500
You know, it's only 11:15. I'm already waiting in the line. It's kind of unique.
- I'm gonna have brisket, please, with your mac and cheese and the beans. This barbecue is known throughtout all of areas being the best. Why?  

14
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Well, it is, just do you see and flavorfull. It lives up to everything that everybody's talking about it. And the line hasn'y die down, people keep coming in it's only 11:20, 11:30 and there's a high demand. Feel like he could make bigger than just Erie by taking the secret sauce literaly and selling it all over the country.

15
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Plus, I'm thinking I could still incororate the beer aspect somehow because I mean what goes better with barbecue than beer. This is juicy as it comments me.

16
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:24,500
If I open a barbecure and beer restaurant that I can serve food and beer, I just need a space with a liquor license. The silver lining is that the pivot forced me to come up with an even stronger idea. We have 2 ways to grow and create our revenue from the barbecue and the beer 

17
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:44,500
The truth of the matter is that I need the money to start a business. Last week I gave my goal of making $10.000. We're a down payment on a flip house. Just now, I have under $1,500 but I'm still in the car flipping stage at this timeline and I've got this Escalade that I haven't been able to move 

18
00:04:44,500 --> 00:05:00,500
I'm hoping to get at least $7.500 out of it. Put it in my lucky street corner. However, I just got a call from a guy named Joey and he wants to by my Escalade. I need this money, if I don't sell the car, I can't get the house

19
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,500
I should have it down for $8.900, it's not cheap. Hopefully this guy is serious. I really need this

20
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,500
I've been checking abandoned lots along the rail line searching for industrial tires and wrought iron to resale. I've got almost every lot out there but there's a few left to try

21
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:24,500
- Joey
- Hey Glenn
- How this's going
- Looks pretty good
- Yeah, you know, it's a great car
- Run alright?
- It's runs great, runs really well. Got the third row seats 

22
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:40,500
- Yeah, that's 7 in here
- It's 7, that's good, just about everything you can ask for in an Escalade. I don't know if you ever had one before but ride smooth
- Have not happened before but I've been looking for one. Hmm, you know, test drive?
- Let's do it, yeah, absolutely

23
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Ther's a say never let them see you sweat, right? You got to be kind of cool, you got to make sure you don't lose your leverage. So, you know, I wanted the guy to take a first spin, I wanted to make sure he knew, you know, that car was a good value.

24
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:04,500
- What do you think?
- Thanks for drive man. Thought it was good
- Alright, drive nice huh
- Yeah, I think I'm interested
- Good

25
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,500
- Could you do something more like 7, I don't know, about that into $8.900 
- $7.000

26
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:17,500
I feel so much pressure, like this guy can't walk away. I need this right now, I don't have a lot of time

27
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:34,500
- I think that's pretty fair
- You're killing me. Come on, car worth $8.900. What do you say, $7.800, call it a day
- Like $7.500
- $7.600, number is good
- Alright. I brought it, so it's nice to go home with a bus man

28
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:54,500
You know, I mean, I've spent my entire life trying not to celebrate the highs too high or the low too low. But these wins, these little wins, they feel so important. I didn't make my $10.000 but I think I've enough money for a down payment and clothing costs as well as money to cover my living expenses while I'm here in Erie 

29
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,500
I got some money, I'm on my way.

30
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:04,500
-----------------------------------------------

31
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:04,500
- What are you looking at to get out of them
- I was thinking about well 1800
- With the cuts and stuff upright, can't go that much price. You like 1400?
- 1400

32
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:04,500
- So you level with me, how about 69
- I'll do 15
- 15, oh you got a deal with. Hey thanks
- Cash alright?
- Cash works great matter of fact

33
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:04,500
That's exactly what I needed. Ok, just get beat up, beat up, beat up working here ass off and I've finally hit the big one

34
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:04,500
I didn't make my goal but I've got enough for a place to live. I need to make do with the money I have and keep moving forward. Finally

35
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:04,500
- Hi, it's Bob. Is it?
- Yes, it is
- Bob, hi, my name is Glenn Bryant. Listen, I'm looking for a budget-friendly apartment and wanted to know if you had anything available
- What's your price range?
- Well, about $400 a month

36
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:04,500
- Perfect, I am available anytime. I could come over even right now.
- Sure
- Thank you very much

37
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:35,500
I am going to find an apartment at least hunting for on today

38
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:45,500
When I was first researching living expenses, I budgeted $625 a month for an apartment but since I didn't hit my first financial goal, I need to come in much lower than that

39
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:56,500
I'm hoping I can get into an apartment for $400, you know, I'm not expecting to be in a great place see what I could afford

40
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:09,500
I'm gonna show you these 2 apartments up here. This is gonna be one of the apartments number 9 here. Got a decent-sized bathroom, nice storage here is wild tub and shower and this is gonna be 405

41
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:16,500
- Where's the bedroom?
- This would be your bed room. This is considered efficiency. This would be your living room and bedroom combine 

42
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:38,500
- I think you'll like this one here. This is gonna go into your kitchen and what's nice about this. You get French doors great here. Nice little fake fireplace
- What's this one run 
- This is gonna be about 435 and it's gonna include just your water sewer trash. I would need a first month's security deposit. You have any question?

43
00:08:38,500 --> 00:09:01,500
- Can I give you my first month's rent and then give you half the deposit and I can two weeks and half the deposit?
- I can't do that. I would need a security deposit up front to hold the unit because if I had another client that came in and put down the security deposit right on the spot. Money talks
- Ok. Alright, I'll take it

44
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:18,500
So, I ended up with the more expensive apartment. $435 vs $405 but reality, I'm off the road. I don't have anybody in the side of me so there's a lot of things that make this one just a much more efficient apartment and there's something I can live in for the next 90 days

45
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:26,500
- There's that for you.
- It's hard to belive that I feel so happy to have a place

46
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Perfect. You know when I'm sitting in my car and having to worry abount where I am. It doesn't allow you to think about business or growing anything and just in survival mode. So having you own place, it's such a huge deal

47
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:52,500
No toilet paper, no bath towels, no so. Even though it's not the Taj Hahal, it's a place just to call my own 

48
00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:10,500
I've been so used to living a cush life and now, everyday figuring out how to make 5 or 10 dollars or how to get a job, doing anything finding, you know, some other's person trash on the side of the road, that's worth something

49
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Anyway, it's a very humbling experience. I'm grateful I have a roof over my head right now but I really need a place where I can start a thrive and get my confidence back

50
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Glenn Stearns will see once and for all
